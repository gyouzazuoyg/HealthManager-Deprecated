<!-- Nathaniel's Code Review - Tesfalidet, Nathaniel ðŸ‘‰ Lin, Zhenghao -->
<!-- I really like your concept of having an application for managing your diet plan. It's very useful for others who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. -->
<!-- The design for your pages, specifically the diet plan page, looks really great. A simple design that's intuitive to follow through with a really nice choice of colors. -->
<!-- I like how you abstract your database operations in your myDB.js file and applied them to specific database operations for users, food and diet. -->
<!-- I know this was mentioned in another code review but make sure to not commit your MONGO URL credentials to prevent yourself from any malicious hacks. -->
<!-- It would be nice if you could either add your deployment link for your web app, add a video demo to your project, or add more details to your README file. -->
<!-- This allows for anyone who is looking at your repo to have a better understanding of the looks and functionality of your web app. -->
<!-- I believe your front (or frontend) folder hasn't been committed to your repo. Showing your frontend folder makes it easier for anyone to inspect the UI parts to your web app. -->
<!-- Also make sure to remove any unnecessary folder/files that aren't being used in your project such as your public folder for the backend aspect of your project.  -->
