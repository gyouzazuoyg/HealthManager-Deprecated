//From Daniel -> I think the readme file needs more detail. Following these directions doesn't actually give me access to the website. For example, if I type npm start and then npm run start, I get an error b/c they both try to start localhost:3001, which you can't do. Also, think you might be missing the frontend of you app b/c I don't see it in the folders?

- npm start
- npm run start
- Then visited using: localhost:3000
